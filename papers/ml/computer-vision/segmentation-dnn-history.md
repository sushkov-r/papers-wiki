# History of Deep Learning–Based Segmentation

## 1. Early CNN Segmentation (2014–2015)
- **Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN, 2014):** First end-to-end CNN for semantic segmentation. Replaced fully connected layers with convolutional ones to output dense per-pixel predictions.
- **U-Net (2015):** Encoder–decoder with skip connections. Became dominant in medical imaging.

**Key contribution:** Showed CNNs can produce dense segmentation maps, not just classification.

---

## 2. Two-Stage Instance Segmentation (2017)
- **Mask R-CNN (2017):** Extension of Faster R-CNN. Adds:
  - A **parallel mask branch** for per-instance binary masks.
  - **RoIAlign** (replacing RoI Pooling) for pixel-accurate alignment.
- Flexible and extensible (later adapted for keypoints, human pose).

**Impact:** Became the workhorse of instance segmentation.

## 3. Refinements and One-Stage Alternatives (2018–2020)
- **PANet (2018):** Added feature pyramid enhancements and mask information flow to Mask R-CNN.
- **YOLACT (2019):** One-stage real-time instance segmentation using prototype masks + linear combination.
- **SOLO & SOLOv2 (2019–2020):** “Segmenting Objects by Locations” — direct instance segmentation without box proposals.

**Trend:** Shift toward faster, simpler models.

---

## 4. Transformer Era of Segmentation (2020–2022)
- **DETR (2020):** Introduced transformers for object detection. Set-prediction with bipartite matching; no anchors or NMS.
- **Deformable DETR (2020):** Sparse attention for faster training and better small-object handling.
- **MaskFormer (2021):** Unified semantic + instance segmentation using per-segment embeddings.
- **Mask2Former (2022):** Improved MaskFormer with masked attention; strong across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation.

**Impact:** Transformers unify segmentation tasks under a clean set-based formulation.

---

## 5. DETR Variants and DINO Family (2021–2023)
- **Conditional / DAB-DETR (2021):** Introduced spatially meaningful object queries (anchors).
- **DN-DETR (2022):** Added denoising training for stability.
- **DINO (2022):** Combined DN-DETR and DAB-DETR with iterative refinement and mixed query selection. Stronger performance, faster convergence.
- **Mask DINO (2022):** Added mask prediction; unified detection + segmentation.

**Impact:** Transformer-based models surpassed CNN-based two-stage frameworks.

---

## 6. Current State of the Art (2024–2025)
- **DI-MaskDINO (2024):** Balanced decoder optimization between detection and segmentation tasks. Improved accuracy on COCO.
- **Large ViT Backbones (e.g., Swin, DINOv3):** Provide powerful feature encoders for segmentation.
- **SparseInst & Real-Time Models:** Achieve ~40 FPS on COCO with competitive accuracy, important for deployment.

**Summary:**
- Transformers (Mask2Former, Mask DINO, DI-MaskDINO) dominate accuracy benchmarks.
- Specialized lightweight models (SparseInst, YOLACT) target real-time applications.
- Unified frameworks handle **semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation** in one model.
